This file is to describe the details of this game.
Let the probability of A showing head was x, the 1-x was the probalibility of A showing flower.
Let the probability of B showing head was y, the 1-y was the probalibility of B showing flower.
Then the expect of B's income was 3xy+(1-x)(1-y)-2x(1-y)-2y(1-x) = 8xy-3x-3y+1
If we control x as 3/8, then no matter what strategy B choose, B will lost money gradually.
Because, the expext was -1/8.
